# Computational Statistics

**Population** - Collection of items of interest. It is a universal set. A population can be a group of people or group of objects. The researcher decides the population. 

>*Eg* - All mustangs produced by Ford in 2025.

**Census** - When researchers gather data from the entire population for a given measurement. 

**Sample** - Representation of a population or a whole. A researcher often prefers using a sample because it is more cost effective, efficient and accurate. 

>*Eg* - to test the quality of a bulb manufacturing company, a researcher will randomly select 75-100 bulbs and test them instead of testing all of them. Then the quality will be determined, and the company will be assessed based on the result.

**Descriptive Statistics** - When a researcher makes a conclusion on the same group based on the collected data of a group. 

**Inferential / Inductive Statistics** -  When a researcher makes a conclusion based on the sample for a group. The use and importance of inferential statistics continue to grow. 

**Parameter** - Descriptive measure of a population is called a parameter. Usually denoted by greek letters. 

**Statistic** - Descriptive measure of a sample is called a Statistic.Usually denoted by Roman letters.

>*For example* - A Washing machine manufacturer would want to determine the average loads that a machine can wash before repair. The parameter is the population mean or average number of washes before repair. 
A company researcher takes a sample of machines, computes the average number of washes before repair and estimates the population value or parameter by using statistics, which in this case is sample average.


**Random Variable** - Contains the outcomes of the chance experiment.


>*Eg* - Time takes between for a car to reach from 0km/h to 100km/h could be anywhere from 0 seconds, 1second,....n seconds. This is called Random Variable. 

Random variable has two categories - 

+ Discrete Variable
+ Continuous Variable 

**Discrete Variable** - Set of all the possible values that are finite. Can be counted. In most cases it is countable non-negative whole numbers. 
>*Eg*- out of a class of 25 students, how many students will score above 90%? Possible outcomes are between 0 and 25. It cannot be 5.7. 

Continuous Variable - Take on value at every point over a given time interval. They have no gaps or unassumed values.
>*Eg*-Time takes between for a car to reach from 0km/h to 100km/h could be 3.45456 seconds or 2.56782 seconds. It must be a reasonable range. In most cases it is in time, height, weight, volume, etc.

Once continuous data is measured and recorded, it turns into discrete data as it is rounded off. Thus in actual practice, virtually all business data are discrete. But for practical reasons data analysts use  continuous data instead of discrete.

The appropriateness of the data analysis depends on the level of the measurement of the data gathered.

+ Nominal data
+ Ordinal data
+ Interval data
+ Ratio data

Nominal Data - Lowest level of data measurement is called nominal data. Only used to classify or categorize data. Mostly numbers are used and words are omitted.
>*Eg* - Employee identification numbers, questions in surveys are mostly nominal level data.

**Ordinal level** - Level of measurement is higher than that of nominal level. Mostly used for ranking and ordering the data. 
>*Eg*- engagement in live classes can be ranked from 1 to 10. 

Nominal and ordinal are often derived from imprecise measurements.such as demographic questions and categorise objects. 

**Interval level** - Next to the highest level of data.  A type of quantitative data that is measured along a scale in which each point is placed at equal intervals. This means that the difference between any two adjacent points on the scale is equal. Examples of interval data include temperature scales like Celsius or Fahrenheit.The data between the two consecutive numbers have meaning, and the data is always numerical. Zero point in the data is for convenience or convention, it does not mean that data value is 0, such as temperature. 0 is not the lowest temperature.

**Ratio Level** - Highest level of the data measurement. It has the same properties as the interval data but the zero point has the lowest or fixed value with meaning. ( absolute zero ). It represents no value or absence of data at that point. Eg- height, weight, etc

Statistical techniques can be categorized into 2 types - 
+ Parametric Stat - Data must be in interval form or Ratio form.
+ Non-parametric Stat - Data can be nominal or ordinal, Interval and ratio data can be analyzed too.


**Collection of data through questionnaires** - Most popular form of collecting data. Mainly used by MNC’s, private and public research workers in organisations.

**The characteristics of a good questionnaire**
+ The design of a questionnaire will be determined by whether the researcher wishes to collect exploratory data (i.e., qualitative data for the purposes of better understanding or the generation of hypotheses on a subject) or quantitative data (to test specific hypotheses that have previously been generated).   
+ A good questionnaire’s qualities and characteristics.
+ It is necessary to understand what needs to be measured – Having a clear picture and understanding of what data needs to be collected helps to improve data collection quality.  
+ Should  understand  how  to phrase/frame  questions,  and  words  should  be neutral and not leading – Whatever your point of view is, it should never be reflected in the questions. This is done both intentionally and unintentionally, but it must be addressed.  
+ The importance of using the correct word/phrase should not be overlooked
+ The language should be clear so that the necessary data can be received. This also makes the survey question and requirements easier to understand, resulting in a better response and answer.  
+ Define  and  qualify  terms  –  This  is  especially  important  when  conducting a technical or field-specific survey. If you believe that some terms may be unfamiliar to the audience being polled, they must be defined in order to receive a proper response. This will improve the quality while decreasing the bounce rate or the number of unanswered questions.  
+ Avoid using double negatives or more than one negative word in a sentence
+ The use of a negative word has a psychological effect and can influence the response.  
+ Alternatives that are sufficient or adequate should be provided. The available options should contain the most likely answers.  
+ Multiple questions in a row should be avoided, each question should have only one answer. If more than one question must be asked, each one should be treated as a separate question to improve question clarity.   
+ Words that need to be emphasised should be emphasised – it aids in making a point and asking a question. Clear alternatives such as good/bad/fair/ average should be quantified using photographs or other means – These are very ambiguous terms, and how they are interpreted varies from person to person.
+ Unwanted assumptions should be avoided. The goal of a survey is to collect factual data, so assumptions should be avoided.
